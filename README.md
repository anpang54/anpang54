## Hi there!
I'm Anpang54 (real name Anpang).\
I do coding as a hobby. I code in Python, JS, and some Lua, and I also do web dev.

Pronouns: He/Him&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Website: <https://anpang.fun/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[Email me](mailto:anpang59@gmail.com)

### What I'm working on
* [Cornmoji](https://cornmoji.anpang.fun/), an open-source emoji and icon set
* [G<sup>+</sup>](https://github.com/Anpang54/gplus), a new programming language I'm making with [this guy](https://github.com/pique2312)
* Learning Java. It's terrible.

Don't ask what my pfp is, It was so long ago I don't even remember where I got it from.
